			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
	
	Magnus: about 20h
	Andréas about 20h

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

	- We worked pretty much alone and sharing ideas sometimes to the merge our ideas together.
	- Talking to each other and other groups to solve certain problems.

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

	- It was about right, due to it was some time we programmed in C.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

	- Yes, process creation and defunct processes etc.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

	- No.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

	- No.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

	- No.
>> Any other comments?
